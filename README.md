The goal of this project is to determine the most walkable neighborhood(s) in Pittsburgh.
We hope to accomplish this by using traffic data, parking meter data, commmute data, intersections data, and street densities.
These data are analyzed such that we can rank each neighborhood using statistically significant indicators of increased walkability.
